        An experimental camera project, with the webcam picking up and capturing the shapes of peoples' faces it picks up and storing them together in one scene.

        My initial idea behind this project was as something to be able to use to "bridge" the distance that we're all feeling because of COVID, or simply that people feel in long distance relationships in general. It was going to be a multiplayer-usable app, with people in different locations capturing their shapes and then saving them all on the same canvas. Unfortunately, I didn't manage to get around to incorporating any of this multiplayer functionality -- currently there is a spreadsheet that gets saved that stores the shapes, that you could theoretically send along to someone else, but a more dynamic multiplayer functionality would obviously be much better.
